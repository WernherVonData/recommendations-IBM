## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Jupyter Notebooks require a 'data' directory with CSV data files available from the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course: https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025.

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. If I missed some package please let me know to, so I will be able to clarify it here.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This project is a show of my understanding of recomenndation algorithms based on the interactions between users and articles in IBM Watson (https://www.ibm.com/watson).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is only one notebook that was used to solve all of the project questions and accompanying html file generated by that notebook. *.p files are the pickle files that were used by the notebook to load data to verify of the cells. The `project_test.py` is a file provided by Udacity to run test on some of the cells to confirm the results.  

## Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

The data for the analysis was provided by IBM to the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree course.
